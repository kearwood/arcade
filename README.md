Arcade Controller for 2 Players

## Mark 1 Design
Mark 1 has a Sega button layout with two players and extra buttons for menu and coin operation.  8 buttons are included for each player in order to allow both 2x3 layouts (eg, Street Fighter) or 4x1 layouts (eg, NeoGeo).

## Mark 2 Design
Mark 2 adds a trackball and is a bit wider to accomodate it.
